      <p style="background-color:white;color:white:font-size:15pt;padding:10px;width:60&;margin:auto;text-align:justify;line-height:30pt">Loud music[1] is music that is played at a high volume, often to the point where it disturbs others and causes hearing damage. It may include music that is sung live, played with Musical instruments, or with electronic media, such as Radio broadcasting, CD, or MP3 players.</p></br>Playing loud music that can be heard from outside of the property from where it is being played is considered to be rude by many societies. Among those opposed to the practice, it may result in the loss of respect and possible legal action. In certain contained settings, such as nightclubs or concerts, music is often played very loudly, but is viewed as acceptable. </p>
